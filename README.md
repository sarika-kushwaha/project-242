# WHAT IS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN? WHERE DOES IT HAPPEN? AND WHY?

Violence against women (VAW) is any act of
gender-based violence (GBV) that results
in or is likely to result in physical, sexual or
psychological harm or suffering to women,
including threats of such acts, coercion
or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether
occurring in public or private life.
VAWG is a violation of human rights, an abuse
of power and a major barrier to achieving
decent and dignified work.
Women and girls experience and fear
various types of SH and other forms of
violence in developed and developing
countries, from unwanted sexual remarks
and groping, to rape and femicide, whether
on streets or public transport, in parks,
on the way to schools and in and around
workplaces including in tea growing areas,
in public sanitation facilities, at water and
food distribution sites, at home, or in their
own neighborhoods.
While women and girls of all social
and economic strata experience and
fear violence, women and girls living in
poverty or belonging to socially excluded
or stigmatized groups (indigenous,
migrants, those living with disability or
HIV/AIDS, displaced persons, etc.) may
be more likely to experience violence,
especially because of experiences of
discrimination, inequality, and limited
access to information, services,
resources and justice. 
The issue of limited access to quality
essential services must also be seen when
working in the context of rural and remote
settings. While unique in geographic
location, these communities often share
a number of common characteristics,
including their small size (in terms of
population), market and labour supply,
their physical isolation from other, and
particularly larger urban centres, their
lack of economic diversification, a weak
and declining economic base and limited
employment opportunities, high production
and servicing costs, and a limited range of
public and private services.
Based on the data available, IPV and nonpartner sexual violence are among the
most prevalent forms of VAWG globally.
These forms of violence have serious
consequences for women and their
children, as well as for communities,
workplaces, and countries. While there
remains much to be learned, knowledge
and practice relating to these forms are
more advanced relative to other forms of
VAWG. For these reasons, the GWSF draws
from research and practice in addressing
these forms of VAWG. However, many of
the general principles and approaches,
identified (See Section 2) may also apply
to other forms of violence and harmful
practices against women, since many of
these forms of violence are interrelated
and may share common risk factors.

In this repo I'm going to talk about women safety promotion.
# Promoting safety for women

We’re committed to respecting and promoting women’s rights, which includes the right to safety of women and girls.Women have suffered physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.

Harassment is one of the eight salient human rights issues we’ve identified for our business. Women have the right to be free from violence, harassment and discrimination and removing the barriers of an unsafe environment can help women fulfil their potential as individuals and as contributors to work, communities and economies. But the World Health Organization estimates that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.

While it’s hard to put a price on the emotional and physical impact of violence on women’s health and wellbeing, research suggests the cost of violence against women each year is around US$1.5 trillion – that’s an estimated 2% of global GDP.

The importance of protecting women’s rights is recognised in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those on Gender Equality (SDG 5) and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).

We’re promoting safety for women in our workplaces and our extended supply chain. Our aim is to implement policies and processes that women trust, with an emphasis on addressing the harmful social and cultural norms and behaviours that can leave women at risk. This is a moral obligation, and we know it’s essential if our business is to maintain the trust and reputation we aspire to.
# Combating domestic violence
Domestic violence can be physical or psychological, and it can affect anyone of any age, gender, race or sexual orientation. Alongside the physical and emotional toll, there is a significant economic impact. Loss of income, absenteeism and a fall in productivity financially impacts individuals and their families as well as society at large. Yet despite these human and societal costs, domestic violence often goes unreported due to fear and stigma.

We want to create a workplace culture where people know they can access support safely and securely, so that employees can seek help without stigma and where staff have access to basic training to know how to respond appropriately if they feel a colleague is potentially at risk. That’s why we introduced our Global Domestic Violence and Abuse Policy.
 which details access to ‘safe leave’, flexible working conditions and support services.

To mark International Women’s Day in March 2021, we offered open access to our policy to other businesses and organisations. Our Chief Brand Officer and Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, Aline Santos, also hosted a LinkedIn live event with the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke.
