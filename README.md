# Promoting safety for women

We’re committed to respecting and promoting women’s rights, which includes the right to safety of women and girls.Women have suffered physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.

Harassment is one of the eight salient human rights issues we’ve identified for our business. Women have the right to be free from violence, harassment and discrimination and removing the barriers of an unsafe environment can help women fulfil their potential as individuals and as contributors to work, communities and economies. But the World Health Organization estimates that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.

While it’s hard to put a price on the emotional and physical impact of violence on women’s health and wellbeing, research suggests the cost of violence against women each year is around US$1.5 trillion – that’s an estimated 2% of global GDP.

The importance of protecting women’s rights is recognised in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those on Gender Equality (SDG 5) and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).

We’re promoting safety for women in our workplaces and our extended supply chain. Our aim is to implement policies and processes that women trust, with an emphasis on addressing the harmful social and cultural norms and behaviours that can leave women at risk. This is a moral obligation, and we know it’s essential if our business is to maintain the trust and reputation we aspire to.
